<h1>Harshavardhan Kurra presents</h1>
<h3>As You Like It</h3>
<h4>Act 1, Scene 2
    Previous scene | Next scene SCENE II.</h4>
<p><p class="speech">SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter CELIA</p>
    
    <h6 class="celia">CELIA</h6>
    <p>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter ROSALIND</p>
    <h6 class="rosalind">ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
        and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
        teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
        learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</p>
    <h6 class="celia">CELIA</h6>
    <p>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
        that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
        had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
        hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
        love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
        if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
        tempered as mine is to thee.</p>
    <h6 class="rosalind">ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</p>
    rejoice in yours.
    <h6 class="celia">CELIA</h6>
    <P>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
        like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
        be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
        father perforce, I will render thee again in
        affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
        that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
        sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</P>
    <h6 class="rosalind">ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see; what think you of falling in love?</p>
    
    <h6 class="celia">CELIA</h6>
    <p>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
        love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
        neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
        in honour come off again.</p>
    <h6 class="rosalind">ROSALIND</h6>
    <p>What shall be our sport, then?</p>
    <h6 class="celia">CELIA</h6>
    <p>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
        her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</p></p>
