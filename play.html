<p>SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.
    Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
    CELIA
    I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
    ROSALIND
    Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
    and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
    teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
    learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
    CELIA
    Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
    that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
    had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
    hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
    love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
    if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
    tempered as mine is to thee.
    ROSALIND
    Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.
    CELIA
    You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
    like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
    be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
    father perforce, I will render thee again in
    affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
    that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
    sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
    ROSALIND
    From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
    me see; what think you of falling in love?
    CELIA
    Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
    love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
    neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
    in honour come off again.
    ROSALIND
    What shall be our sport, then?
    CELIA
    Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
    her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</p>
