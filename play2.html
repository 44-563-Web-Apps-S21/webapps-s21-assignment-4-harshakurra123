        <p>I would we could do so, for her benefits are
            mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
            doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</p>
        <h6 class="name">CELIA</h6>
        <p>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
            makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
            makes very ill-favouredly.</p>
        <h6 class="name">ROSALIND</h6>
        <p>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
            Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
            not in the lineaments of Nature.</p>
