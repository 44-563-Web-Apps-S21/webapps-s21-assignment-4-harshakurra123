        <p>I would we could do so, for her benefits are
            mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
            doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</p>

        <p>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
            makes honest, and those that she makes honest she

            not in the lineaments of Nature.</p>
